# Data visualization weekend challenge

## Project Description
The project below was a weekend challenge organized by TripleTen. I decided to join the challenge to practice my data visualization skills.

## Data Description
CQI maintains a web database that serves as a resource for coffee professionals and enthusiasts who are interested in learning about coffee quality and sustainability. The database includes a range of information on coffee production, processing, and sensory evaluation. It also contains data on coffee genetics, soil types, and other factors that can affect coffee quality.
